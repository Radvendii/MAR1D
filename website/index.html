  Mario. An inscrutable cartoon figure, beloved by many, but understood by few. To delve into the depths of this Italian plumber's psyche, to truly understand the man behind the mustache, we decided that we needed to see the world from his eyes.
</p>
<p>
  The world that Mario inhabited in his early years is different from ours in many ways, but foremost among them is that it is 2-dimensional. This means that Mario only sees in 1 dimension. When you, the player, see a goomba coming from a whole screen away, and can carefully track its movement, Mario sees only a brown line, terrifyingly wobbling towards him.
