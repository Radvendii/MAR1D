# MAR1D

Have you ever considered Mario's perspective? This a game written by Taeer Baryaam that is a first-person clone of Mario. But wait, you say, Mario is 2D! How could you have a first-person view? Well, the answer, my friend, is that you can, but unlike a first person view of a 3D game, which is actually projected onto a 2D screen, this is a first person view of a 2D game, and therefore projected onto a 1D screen, in other words a line. If you're confused, read Flatland.

# Playing the Game

If you are on a Mac, simply open the MAR1D.app included in the repository. Otherwise, have fun trying to port MAR1D to whatever platform you're on; everything should work currently except the audio, which is a teensy bit awful.
