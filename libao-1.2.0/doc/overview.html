<h1>libao Overview</h1>

<p>
Libao is designed to make it easy to do simple audio output using
various audio devices and libraries.  For this reason, complex audio
control features are missing and will probably never be added.
However, if you just want to be able to open whatever audio device is
available and play sound, libao should be just fine.

<p>
The libao API makes a distinction between drivers and devices.  A
driver is a set of functions that allow audio to be played on a
particular platform (i.e. Solaris, ESD, etc.).  A device is a
particular output target that uses a driver.  In addition, libao
distinguishes between <i>live</i> output drivers, which write audio to
playback devices (sound cards, etc.), and <i>file</i> output drivers,
which write audio to disk in a particular format.

<p>
To use libao in your program, you need to follow these steps:
<ul>
<li>Include the &lt;ao/ao.h&gt; header into your program.
<p>

<li>Call <a href="ao_initialize.html">ao_initialize()</a> to
initialize the library.  This loads the plugins from disk, reads the
libao <a href="config.html">configuration files</a>, and identifies an
appropriate default output driver if none is specified in the
configuration files.
<p>

<li>Call <a
href="ao_default_driver_id.html">ao_default_driver_id()</a> to get the
ID number of the default output driver.  This may not be successful if
no audio hardware is available, it is in use, or is not in the "standard"
configuration.  If you want to specify a particular output driver, you
may call <a href="ao_driver_id.html">ao_driver_id()</a> with a string
corresponding to the short name of the device (i.e. "oss", "wav",
etc.) instead.
<p>

<li>If you are using the default device, no extra options are needed.
However, if you wish to to pass special options to the driver, you
will need to:
<p>

<ul>
<li>Create an option list pointer of type <tt>(<a
href="ao_option.html">ao_option</a> *)</tt> and initialize it to
<tt>NULL</tt>.
<p>

<li>Through successive calls to <a
href="ao_append_option.html">ao_append_option()</a>, add any
driver-specific options you need.  Note that the options take the form
of key/value pairs where supported keys are listed in the <a
href="drivers.html">driver documentation</a>.
</ul>
<p>

<li>Call <a href="ao_open_live.html">ao_open_live()</a> and save the
returned device pointer.  If you are using a file output driver, you
will need to call <a href="ao_open_file.html">ao_open_file()</a>
instead.
<p>

<li>Call <a href="ao_play.html">ao_play()</a> to output each
block of audio.
<p>

<li>Call <a href="ao_close.html">ao_close()</a> to close the device.
Note that this will automatically free the memory that was allocated
for the device.  Do not attempt to free the device pointer yourself!
<p>

<li>Call <a href="ao_shutdown.html">ao_shutdown()</a> to close the
library.
</ul>
