I think these are the next steps:

- make the plugins dynamically loadable (done)
- make a ao-config liek gtk-config instead of ao_libs.inc (done)
- extend the configuration files to allow default options for
  each driver
- Sample rate conversion on the fly to support sound cards that have few
  sample rate options (like the i810 audio device, which only does 48000)
- Actually test the IRIX plugin.  :)
- Test the macosx plugin
